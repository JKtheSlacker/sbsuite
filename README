SBsuite is the script jkwood uses for generating the bare framework
for SlackBuilds. In specific, it autofills the .info file, creates
a default README and slack-desc, and produces a .SlackBuild file with
sane defaults.

It's natural that each build will require some editing, whether due 
to unconventional file layout, differing build systems, nonstandard
documentation files, or just plain hardcoding. However, this script
is set up to get you up and running with a single command.
